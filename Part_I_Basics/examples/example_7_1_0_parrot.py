# How the input() Function Works
# The input() function pauses your program and waits for the user to enter
# some text. Once Python receives the userâ€™s input, it stores it in a
# variable to make it convenient for you to work with.

message = input("Tell me something, and I will repeat it back to you: ")
print(message)
