# 10-2. Learning C: You can use the replace() method to replace any word in a
# string with a different word. Hereâ€™s a quick example showing how to replace
# 'dog' with 'cat' in a sentence:

# >>> message = "I really like dogs."
# >>> message.replace('dog', 'cat')
# 'I really like cats.'

# Read in each line from the file you just created, learning_python.txt, and
# replace the word Python with the name of another language, such as C. Print
# each modified line to the screen.

file_name = "exercise_10_1_learning_python.txt"

with open(file_name) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        line.replace("Python", "C")
        print(line.rstrip())
