# 10-13. Verify User: The final listing for remember_me.py assumes either
# that the user has already entered their username or that the program is
# running for the first time. We should modify it in case the current user is
# not the person who last used the program. Before printing a welcome back
# message in greet_user(), ask the user if this is the correct username. If
# itâ€™s not, call get_new_username() to get the correct username.
