# 10-1. Learning Python: Open a blank file in your text editor and write a
# few lines summarizing what youâ€™ve learned about Python so far. Start each
# line with the phrase In Python you can.... Save the file as
# learning_python.txt in the same directory as your exercises from this
# chapter. Write a program that reads the file and prints what you wrote
# three times. Print the contents once by reading in the entire file, once by
# looping over the file object, and once by storing the lines in a list and
# then working with them outside the with block.

file_name = "exercise_10_1_learning_python.txt"

# Printing the contents by reading in the entire file.
with open(file_name) as file_object:
    entire_file = file_object.read()
    print(entire_file)

# Printing the contents by looping over the file object.
with open(file_name) as file_object:
    for line in file_object:
        print(line.rstrip())

# Printing the contents by storing the lines in a list and then working with
# them outside the with block.
