# 10-6. Addition: One common problem when prompting for numerical input
# occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
# the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts
# for two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the
# TypeError if either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error
# message. Test your program by entering two numbers and then by entering
# some text instead of a number.

    print(str(first_number) + " + " + str(second_number) + " = " + str(sum))
