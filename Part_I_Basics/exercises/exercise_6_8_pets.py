# 6-8. Pets: Make several dictionaries, where the name of each dictionary is
# the name of a pet. In each dictionary, include the kind of animal and the
# ownerâ€™s name. Store these dictionaries in a list called pets. Next,
# loop through your list and as you do print everything you know about each
# pet.
