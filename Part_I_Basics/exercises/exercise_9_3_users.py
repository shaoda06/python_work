# 9-3. Users: Make a class called User. Create two attributes called
# first_name and last_name, and then create several other attributes that are
# typically stored in a user profile. Make a method called describe_user()
# that prints a summary of the userâ€™s information. Make another method called
# greet_user() that prints a personalized greeting to the user. Create
# several instances representing different users, and call both methods for
# each user.
