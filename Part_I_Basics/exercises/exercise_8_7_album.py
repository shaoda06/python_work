# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces
# of information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing
# different albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are
# storing the album information correctly. Add an optional parameter to
# make_album() that allows you to store the number of tracks on an album. If
# the calling line includes a value for the number of tracks, add that value
# to the albumâ€™s dictionary. Make at least one new function call that
# includes the number of tracks on an album.
