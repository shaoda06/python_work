# 8-14. Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a
# dictionary. The function should always receive a manufacturer and a model
# name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call
# the function with the required information and two other name-value pairs,
# such as a color or an optional feature. Your function should work for a
# call like this one: car = make_car('subaru', 'outback', color='blue',
# tow_package=True) Print the dictionary thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the
# information was stored correctly.
