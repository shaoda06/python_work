# 6-9. Favorite Places: Make a dictionary called favorite_places. Think of
# three names to use as keys in the dictionary, and store one to three
# favorite places for each person. To make this exercise a bit more
# interesting, ask some friends to name a few of their favorite places. Loop
# through the dictionary, and print each personâ€™s name and their favorite
# places.
