# 5-1. Conditional Tests: Write a series of conditional tests. Print a statement
# describing each test and your prediction for the results of each test. Your code
# should look something like this:

car = "subaru"
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("Is car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'audi')
